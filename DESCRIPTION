Description: R implementation of the 'Pscan' algorithm for motif enrichment 
    analysis in regulatory DNA sequences, based on Zambelli et al. (2009) 
    doi:10.1093/nar/gkp464.
    'PscanR' scans a set of DNA sequences (e.g., promoters) from co-regulated 
    or co-expressed genes, using transcription factor binding motifs from 
    databases such as JASPAR. It identifies significantly enriched motifs,
    providing thus hints on which transcription factors could be common 
    regulators of the genes studied, together with the location of their 
    candidate binding sites in the sequences.
