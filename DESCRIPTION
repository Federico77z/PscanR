Description: R implementation of the Pscan algorithm for sequence motif enrichment
  analysis by Zambelli et al. (2009) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkp464>. Pscan is a 
  software tool that scans a set of sequences (e.g. promoters) from co-regulated 
  or co-expressed genes with motifs describing the binding specificity of known 
  transcription factors and assesses which motifs are significantly over- or 
  under-represented, providing thus hints on which transcription factors could 
  be common regulators of the genes studied, together with the location of their 
  candidate binding sites in the sequences.
