\title{Retrieve Motif Hit Scores from a Background Dataset (Generic Function)}
\usage{
ps_hits_score_bg(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object containing motif scan results.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to specific methods.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item If `x` is a `PSMatrix` object: a **named numeric vector**, where 
  names correspond to promoter sequence identifiers and values represent 
  their respective motif hit scores.
  \item If `x` is another supported class, the return format may differ.
}

\description{
ps_hits_score_bg is a generic function designed to extract motif hit scores 
from a background dataset. These scores quantify the binding affinity or 
enrichment level of promoter sequences when scanned using a Position Weight 
Matrix (PWM). This function is specifically useful for analyzing background 
matrices, which serve as reference datasets in pscan analyses.
}
\details{
Methods should be implemented for specific object classes that store 
motif scanning results.


The `ps_hits_score_bg` function is particularly relevant for background 
datasets, which include motif scan results computed across all promoter 
sequences. These background scores provide a reference for comparison in 
motif enrichment analyses, helping to assess the significance of observed 
motif occurrences. 

In a PSMatrixList object, the `ps_hits_score_bg` slot is populated only for 
background matrices (i.e., matrices derived from all promoters). This ensures 
that the pscan() function can access precomputed scores without recomputing 
them, optimizing efficiency.
