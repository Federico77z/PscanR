\title{Build background matrices in parallel}
\usage{
ps_build_bg(x, pfms, BPPARAM = bpparam(), BPOPTIONS = bpoptions())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `DNAStringSet` object (see Biostrings package) containing the set 
of regulatory sequences of the organism of study (e.g., gene promoters 
retrieved from a `TxDb` object). These sequences are the target for 
background scanning.}

\item{pfms}{A `PSMatrixlist` of position frequency matrices representing 
transcription factor binding preferences, obtained for example from the 
JASPAR database.}

\item{BPPARAM}{Parallelization parameter passed to `bplapply` function from 
the `BiocParallel` package. This parameter controls how the parallel
processing is executed.
See `BiocParallel` package for more details.}

\item{BPOPTIONS}{Optional configuration settings passed to `bplapply` 
function from the `BiocParallel` package. This can include additional
options to control the behavior of parallel execution.
See `BiocParallel` documentation for more details.}
}
\value{
A `PSMatrixList` object, containing each motif matrix from `pfms`, 
background-scored against the sequences in `x`.
}
\description{
Generates a background probability profile matrix list using the BiocParallel
framework for parallel execution. It computes background scores for each 
motif matrix from the JASPAR database against a set of regulatory sequences 
(e.g., gene promoters) using the `ps_scan` function.
}
\details{
A check on inputs is performed with the helper function `.ps_check`, 
specifying `type == 1`. Duplicated sequences are removed from `x` to avoid 
redundant computations. 
The motif matrices are background scored by the `ps_scan` function in parallel.
